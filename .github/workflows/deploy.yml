# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # - name: Set up Python
      #   uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      #   with:
      #     python-version: '3.9'

      # # Step 3: Install dependencies (if any)
      # - name: Install dependencies
      #   run: |
      #     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      #     pip install -r requirements.txt
          
      # - name: Run Python script
      #   run: python test.py
   
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: |
          # echo "$diff_files"
          echo "diff_files=$(git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-only)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
